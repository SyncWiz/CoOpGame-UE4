# CoopGame-UE4
Coop Game to showcase my UE4 skills, including:
- Basic AI using C++
- Advanced AI using behavior trees, EQS & Env Queries
- Networked gameplay (authority handling and replication)
- Basic UI (Crosshair & health indicators)
- Power-Ups (Health & speed)
- Enemy wave and spawning system

# Game Demo
The project has a demo map where waves of enemies spawned, and players have to kill them. There are also a few spawn points where the player can pick up power-ups. The game is fully networked, so players can join a host and play remotely.

# UE4 Version
Last UE4 engine version tested: 4.26.2
